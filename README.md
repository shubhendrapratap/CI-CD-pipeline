File Descriptions
Dockerfile:

This file contains the instructions to build a Docker image for the Node.js application. It specifies the base image, sets the working directory, installs dependencies, copies the application code, exposes the necessary port, and defines the command to run the application.

FROM node:20.13.1-alpine3.18

WORKDIR /app

COPY package*.json ./

RUN npm install --only=production

COPY . .

EXPOSE 4000

CMD ["node", "app.js"]

package.json:

This file contains metadata about the project, including the project name, version, description, and dependencies. It is used by npm to manage the project's packages.
{
  "name": "my-node-app",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "A simple Node.js application",
  "main": "app.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node app.js"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.17.1"
  }
}

app.js:

This is the main application file that contains the code for the Node.js server. It typically uses the Express framework to handle HTTP requests and responses.

const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 4000;

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello, World!');
});

app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on port ${PORT}`);
});


k8s/deployment.yaml:

This file defines the Kubernetes deployment configuration for the application. It specifies the desired state for the application, including the number of replicas, the container image to use, and the ports to expose.

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-node-app-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-node-app
